#EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1:0 "United Nations of Earth"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1:0 "地球联合国"
#EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "The myriad Human nations that constitute their interstellar government are disparate, yet united in purpose. These bipedal mammalians have developed a society that encourages and even thrives on individual freedoms and cultural differences - as a result, Humans tend to integrate well with alien populations.\n\nDespite this, they have strong martial traditions (produced by millennia of intermittent warfare on their homeworld) and their sometimes aggressive and unpredictable nature should not be underestimated."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "无数的人类国家在星际间建立了不同的政府， 但他们为了某个目的而联合了起来。 现在，这些双足哺乳动物已经发展成了一个充满个人自由和文化差异的社会，- 而这个社会所带来的结果，则是这些人类希望更好的与外星物种相融合。\n\n尽管如此, 他们拥有的强大武力（来自他们家园里持续上千年断断续续的战争），以及他们有时极具侵略性和变幻莫测的本性是不容小视的。"
#EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2:0 "Commonwealth of Man"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2:0 "人类联邦"
#EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:0 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships were fitted with powerful but unstable wormhole generators and sent towards distant stars carrying a quarter million colonists each. None were heard from again, and research into subspace wormholes was soon abandoned.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships made it to a lush alien moon and established a flourishing colony. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost."

#EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn_desc:0 "The Tzynn evolved from carnivorous, pack-hunting lizards that prowled the dunes of Tzynnia. They eventually developed a highly structured, hierarchical society that emphasized order and martial prowess above all else.\n\nBy the time the Tzynn entered the industrial age, a series of devastating global wars launched by a particularly ruthless warlord had already seen the establishment of a single, world-spanning nation. From these humble beginnings, the illustrious and ever-lasting Tzynn Empire was born."

#EMPIRE_DESIGN_yondar_desc:0 "The proud Yondar are an old race, using their wings to soar high above the steaming jungles of Yondarim for more than 200,000 years before they developed rudimentary technology and formed their first few scattered civilizations.\n\nOnce this development started, things progressed more rapidly and the Sky Clans grudgingly abandoned many of their most primitive traditions. The Yondar are highly spiritual and place great importance on religion, venerating their high kings as living gods."

#EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar_desc:0 "The first Ix'Idar broods developed in the subterranean cave networks deep beneath the surface of Ix'Athrak. By the time an Ix'Idar scout burrowed through to the surface and glimpsed sunlight for the first time, the insectoid race had already established a thriving Iron Age civilization.\n\nWith the resources they found on the surface, the Ix'Idar developed rapidly. Just a few centuries later their first space probes left orbit to survey the other worlds within the Ix'Im system."

#EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr_desc:0 "The Chinorr began their evolutionary journey as dexterous cephalopod analogues. They used their many tentacles to swing between trees in the lush jungles of Chicora, ambushing prey on the ground and injecting them with a potent nerve toxin.\n\nBy the time the Chinorr split the atom, the resources of Chicora had been ruthlessly exploited and the planet's jungles had long since disappeared. This was considered a necessary sacrifice in the relentless pursuit of knowledge and heavy industry that the unsentimental Chinorr were now engaged in."

#EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma_desc:0 "An "individual" among the Jehetma is actually a large colony of fungi that has developed sentience. Some of these colonies, generally those that have lived for thousands of years, stretch across several miles and rarely leave the surface of Jehet Prime, their homeworld (few ships are large enough to transport them).\n\nYounger colonies are not only smaller, but also tend to be more dynamic and mobile - they often spearhead the exploration and research efforts of the Jehetma, as well as any defensive measures that are regrettably undertaken when the Dominion is beset by aggressors."

#EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari_desc:0 "The Scyldari are aquatic mammalians originating from the archipelagos and deep oceans of Scyldaria. Although their early civilizations were mostly confined to the sea, they soon expanded onto what little landmass the planet had to offer.\n\nTheir society adapted accordingly, building an advanced industry that exploited the riches of the ocean floor without harming Scyldaria's delicate ecosystem. Scyldari philosophy is one of balance and moderation in all things, a lesson learned from having to nurse their limited resources when they were confined to the bottom of the sea."

#EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan_desc:0 "These furry, cold-blooded mammalians have developed a complex honor code and martial culture. The Kel-Azaan were once solitary herbivores that journeyed from cave to cave across the icy wastes of Azak to feed off roots and lichen. To defend against predators, bands of Kel-Azaan gathered annually to hunt the hunters and keep the cave routes safe. They eventually abandoned this solitary lifestyle in favor of cities and subterranean agriculture, but their martial traditions were never forgotten."

The Shadow Council, a body of influential merchants, is charged with safeguarding trade within the Republic and opening up new markets (by force if necessary)."
